              NASA is targeting no earlier than April 8 for the Ingenuity Mars
              Helicopter to make the first attempt at powered, controlled flight
              of an aircraft on another planet. Before the 4-pound
              (1.8-kilogram) rotorcraft can attempt its first flight, however,
              both it and its team must meet a series of daunting milestones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ingenuity remains attached to the belly of NASA&rsquo;s
              Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars Feb. 18. On March
              21, the rover deployed the guitar case-shaped graphite composite
              debris shield that protected Ingenuity during landing. The rover
              currently is in transit to the &ldquo;airfield&rdquo; where
              Ingenuity will attempt to fly. Once deployed, Ingenuity will have
              30 Martian days, or sols, (31 Earth days) to conduct its test
              flight campaign.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;When NASA&rsquo;s Sojourner rover landed on Mars in 1997,
              it proved that roving the Red Planet was possible and completely
              redefined our approach to how we explore Mars. Similarly, we want
              to learn about the potential Ingenuity has for the future of
              science research,&rdquo; said Lori Glaze, director of the
              Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters. &ldquo;Aptly
              named, Ingenuity is a technology demonstration that aims to be the
              first powered flight on another world and, if successful, could
              further expand our horizons and broaden the scope of what is
              possible with Mars exploration.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              Flying in a controlled manner on Mars is far more difficult than
              flying on Earth. The Red Planet has significant gravity (about
              one-third that of Earth&rsquo;s), but its atmosphere is just 1% as
              dense as Earth&rsquo;s at the surface. During Martian daytime, the
              planet&rsquo;s surface receives only about half the amount of
              solar energy that reaches Earth during its daytime, and nighttime
              temperatures can drop as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit
              (minus 90 degrees Celsius), which can freeze and crack unprotected
              electrical components.
            </p>

            <p>
              To fit within the available accommodations provided by the
              Perseverance rover, the Ingenuity helicopter must be small. To fly
              in the Mars environment, it must be lightweight. To survive the
              frigid Martian nights, it must have enough energy to power
              internal heaters. The system &ndash; from the performance of its
              rotors in rarified air to its solar panels, electrical heaters,
              and other components &ndash; has been tested and retested in the
              vacuum chambers and test labs of NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion
              Laboratory in Southern California.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;Every step we have taken since this journey began six years
              ago has been uncharted territory in the history of
              aircraft,&rdquo; said Bob Balaram, Mars Helicopter chief engineer
              at JPL. &ldquo;And while getting deployed to the surface will be a
              big challenge, surviving that first night on Mars alone, without
              the rover protecting it and keeping it powered, will be an even
              bigger one.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <h2>Deploying the Helicopter</h2>

            <p>
              Before Ingenuity takes its first flight on Mars, it must be
              squarely in the middle of its airfield &ndash; a 33-by-33-foot
              (10-by-10-meter) patch of Martian real estate chosen for its
              flatness and lack of obstructions. Once the helicopter and rover
              teams confirm that Perseverance is situated exactly where they
              want it to be inside the airfield, the elaborate process to deploy
              the helicopter on the surface of Mars begins.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;As with everything with the helicopter, this type of
              deployment has never been done before,&rdquo; said Farah Alibay,
              Mars Helicopter integration lead for the Perseverance rover.
              &ldquo;Once we start the deployment there is no turning back. All
              activities are closely coordinated, irreversible, and dependent on
              each other. If there is even a hint that something isn&rsquo;t
              going as expected, we may decide to hold off for a sol or more
              until we have a better idea what is going on.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              The
              <a
                href="

							mars-helicopter-will-reach-the-red-planets-
							surface/"
                >helicopter deployment process</a
              >
              will take about six sols (six days, four hours on Earth). On the
              first sol , the team on Earth will activate a bolt-breaking
              device, releasing a locking mechanism that helped hold the
              helicopter firmly against the rover&rsquo;s belly during launch
              and Mars landing. The following sol, they will fire a
              cable-cutting pyrotechnic device, enabling the mechanized arm that
              holds Ingenuity to begin rotating the helicopter out of its
              horizontal position. This is also when the rotorcraft will extend
              two o f its four landing legs.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the third sol of the deployment sequence, a small electric
              motor will finish rotating Ingenuity until it latches, bringing
              the helicopter completely vertical. During the fourth sol, the
              final two landing legs will snap into position. On each of those
              four sols, the Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and
              eNgineering (WATSON) imager will take confirmation shots of
              Ingenuity as it incrementally unfolds into its flight
              configuration. In its final position, the helicopter will hang
              suspended at about 5 inches (13 centimeters) over the Martian
              surface. At that point, only a single bolt and a couple dozen tiny
              electrical contacts will connect the helicopter to Perseverance.
              On the fifth sol of deployment, the team will use the final
              opportunity to utilize Perseverance as a power source and charge
              Ingenuity&rsquo;s six battery cells.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;Once we cut the cord with Perseverance and drop those final
              5 inches to the surface, we want to have our big friend drive away
              as quickly as possible so we can get the Sun&rsquo;s rays on our
              solar panel and begin recharging our batteries,&rdquo; said
              Balaram.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the sixth and final scheduled sol of this deployment phase, the
              team will need to confirm three things: that Ingenuity&rsquo;s
              four legs are firmly on the surface of Jezero Crater, that the
              rover did, indeed, drive about 16 feet (about 5 meters) away, and
              that both helicopter and rover are communicating via their onboard
              radios. This milestone also initiates the 30-sol clock during
              which time all preflight checks and flight tests must take place.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;Ingenuity is an experimental engineering flight test
              &ndash; we want to see if we can fly at Mars,&rdquo; said MiMi
              Aung, project manager for Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at JPL.
              &ldquo;There are no science instruments onboard and no goals to
              obtain scientific information. We are confident that all the
              engineering data we want to obtain both on the surface of Mars and
              aloft can be done within this 30-sol window.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              As with deployment, the helicopter and rover teams will approach
              the upcoming flight test methodically. If the team misses or has
              questions about an important preflight milestone, they may take
              one or more sols to better understand the issue. If the helicopter
              survives the first night of the sequence period on the surface of
              Mars, however, the team will spend the next several sols doing
              everything possible to ensure a successful flight, including
              wiggling the rotor blades and verifying the performance of the
              inertial measurement unit, as well as testing the entire rotor
              system during a spin-up to 2,537 rpm (while Ingenuity&rsquo;s
              landing gear remain firmly on the surface).
            </p>

            <h2>The First Flight Test on Mars</h2>

            <p>
              Once the team is ready to attempt the first flight, Perseverance
              will receive and relay to Ingenuity the final flight instructions
              from JPL mission controllers. Several factors will determine the
              precise time for the flight, including modeling of local wind
              patterns plus measurements taken by the Mars Environmental
              Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) aboard Perseverance. Ingenuity will run
              its rotors to 2,537 rpm and, if all final self-checks look good,
              lift off. After climbing at a rate of about 3 feet per second (1
              meter per second), the helicopter will hover at 10 feet (3 meters)
              above the surface for up to 30 s econds. Then, the Mars Helicopter
              will descend and touch back down on the Martian surface.
            </p>

            <p>
              Several hours after the first flight has occurred, Perseverance
              will downlink Ingenuity&rsquo;s first set of engineering data and,
              possibly, images and video from the rover&rsquo;s Navigation
              Cameras and Mastcam-Z. From the data downlinked that first evening
              after the flight, the Mars Helicopter team expects to be able to
              determine if their first attempt to fly at Mars was a success.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the following sol, all the remaining engineering data collected
              during the flight, as well as some low-resolution black-and-white
              imagery from the helicopter&rsquo;s own Navigation Camera, could
              be downlinked to JPL. The third sol of this phase, the two images
              taken by the helicopter&rsquo;s high-resolution color camera
              should arrive. The Mars Helicopter team will use all information
              available to determine when and how to move forward with their
              next test.
            </p>

            <p>
              &ldquo;Mars is hard,&rdquo; said Aung. &ldquo;Our plan is to work
              whatever the Red Planet throws at us the very same way we handled
              every challenge we&rsquo;ve faced over the past six years &ndash;
              together, with tenacity and a lot of hard work, and a little
              Ingenuity.&rdquo;
